# BB_To_DS3
A tool to convert xml animations from use in BloodBorne to use in Dark Souls 3

# Usage:

1.Select your input and output location(they have to be in xml format not in hkx, convert them using havok tools)
2.Click Convert Animation and wait for a bit
3.Convert your file back to hkx using havok tools

You can also select a folder to mass convert files, but that's a bit buggy still
